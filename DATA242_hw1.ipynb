    "## Dachshund-Badger Simulation\n",
    "A well know fact is that dachshunds were bred to be world-class badger hunters.  In this exercise, you will create a simple simulation of a dachshund-badger population over time. The dachshund and badger populations will change based on specific rules. You will use loops, functions, and basic plotting to visualize the population dynamics.  You'll have to do a little bit of googling to figure out the plotting part:).\n",

    "Dachshund(t+1)=Dachshund(t)+(δ⋅Badger(t)⋅Dachshund(t))−(γ⋅Dachshund(t))\n",

    " * α: Badger birth rate\n",
    "\n",
    " * β: Death rate of badgers (depends on the predator)\n",

    " * δ: Dachshund reproduction rate (based on consumed badgers)\n",

    " * γ: Dachshunds death rate\n",

    "(Note: In reality, dachshunds typically just corner badgers rather than eating them, but they're known for their ferocity, so I wouldn’t put it past them. Our first dachshund once took down one of my in-laws’ chickens in an instant, yet would roll over for belly rubs from any human. They’re also notorious for barking excessively and have surprisingly large teeth for their size! )\n",
    "\n",
    "You will write a program that uses the following parameter values, and calculates and prints the populations of dachshunds and badgers for each year up to a certain amount as specified below. Since the number of dachshunds and badgers cannot be floating-point numbers, use the in-built python function round() to round-off the calculated values to integers. Also, we cannot have negative rabbits or negative foxes, so if the population values are ever negative, the population should be zero.\n",

    " As a first step to solving this problem you should create a function that takes in 6 parameters prev_badger_num, prev_dachshund_num, alpha (α), beta (β), delta (δ), and gamma (γ).  It should perform the calculation in the equation and return the current badger and dachshund count.  You can use other parameter names if you like but your function must have 6 parameters and return 2 values.  Write your function below:\n",
